FCKeditor for Dada Mail 

This distro for FCKeditor is to be used w/Dada Mail. It: 

* Removes the built-in and security-nightmare included file browser

* Replaces it with stubs to use the KCfinder free alternative

* Integration is done w/the following instructions: 

http://kcfinder.sunhater.com/docs/integrate#session

* We'd rather you use CKEditor, or TinyMCE, and not use FCKeditor. This project is 
only started to support existing installs.
